---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
```

### First Launch

1. Click **"🎬 Start Tracking"** button
2. Use your computer normally
3. Click **X** to close window - app minimizes to tray and keeps tracking!

---

## 💤 Smart Idle Detection

Never worry about inflated screen time from leaving your computer on!

### How It Works

The app automatically detects when you're away from your computer and pauses tracking:

- **Auto-Pause**: After 5 minutes of no keyboard/mouse activity
- **Auto-Resume**: Instantly resumes when you return
- **Smart Detection**: Handles sleep, hibernation, and screen lock
- **Visual Feedback**: Status indicator turns orange when idle
- **Notifications**: Friendly alerts when status changes

### What Triggers Idle?

- No keyboard or mouse input for 5+ minutes
- Computer goes to sleep or hibernation
- Screen is locked
- System is suspended

### Status Indicators

- 🟢 **Green** - Actively tracking your screen time
- 🟠 **Orange** - Paused (system is idle)
- 🔴 **Red** - Stopped (manually stopped by user)

### Configuration

To change the idle timeout, edit `main.py` (line ~380):

```python
self.idle_threshold = 300  # Default: 5 minutes (300 seconds)

# Other options:
self.idle_threshold = 180   # 3 minutes (more sensitive)
self.idle_threshold = 600   # 10 minutes (less sensitive)
self.idle_threshold = 900   # 15 minutes (very relaxed)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Tray icon not visible?**  
**A:** Check Windows Settings → System → Notifications & actions → Select which icons appear on the taskbar → Enable Puthu Tracker

**Q: Idle detection not working?**  
**A:** The threshold is 5 minutes by default. Leave your computer completely untouched for 5+ minutes to test.

**Q: Can't close the app?**  
**A:** Right-click the tray icon and select "Exit". The X button only minimizes to tray.

**Q: Notifications not appearing?**  
**A:** Check Windows Settings → System → Notifications → Make sure notifications are enabled for Python

**Q: High CPU or memory usage?**  
**A:** Normal usage is <2% CPU and 80-120MB RAM. If higher, restart the application.

**Q: Data not saving?**  
**A:** Check that `tracking_data.db` has write permissions and isn't locked by another process.

**Q: Window won't restore from tray?**  
**A:** Try double-clicking the tray icon multiple times, or right-click → "Show Dashboard"

### Debug Mode

To see detailed logs, run with console visible:

```bash
python main.py
```

Look for these helpful messages:
- ✅ "System tray icon initialized"
- 💤 "System went idle (inactive for Xs)"
- 👋 "System active again (was idle for Xs)"
- 📊 "Tracking..." status updates

### Reset Everything

If you encounter persistent issues:

1. Close the app completely (right-click tray → Exit)
2. Delete `tracking_data.db`, `app_categories.json`, `goals_settings.json`, `reminders_settings.json`
3. Restart the application

This will reset all settings and data to defaults.

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Let it run 24/7** - Idle detection prevents inflated time

4. **Categorize apps** - Mark productive/unproductive for insights
5. **Use quick stats** - Right-click tray for instant overview
6. **Export regularly** - Backup your data monthly
